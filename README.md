Working paper in NeurIPS article format discussing standardisation of Equity Ratings through the use of an LSTM algorithm


# Abstract
Equity ratings, which provide Buy/Hold/Sell classifications, are computed based on subjective valuation methods which promote bias and inconsistent metrics across financial institutions. In this paper we propose a standardised way of labelling and computing equity ratings for mid-frequency investment decisions via the use of an LSTM algorithm. This algorithm aims to be a foundational step towards a software used to support traditional finance professionals in portfolio selection. By utilising both stock and commodity data, we seek to explore the potential in augmenting current research in the field. The LSTM algorithm is benchmarked against an ensemble of Random Forests and reveals superior F1 score and other key metrics. This confirms the efficacy of the LSTM model in providing an objective and consistent approach to generating equity ratings.
